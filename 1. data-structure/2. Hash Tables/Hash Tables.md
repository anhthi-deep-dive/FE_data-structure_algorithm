# Hash Tables

A Hash Table, also known as Hash Map, Map (Java), Dictionary (in Python), Object (Javascript) is a data structure that `implements an associative array or dictionary`. It is an abstract data type that `maps keys to values`

A hash table `uses a hash function` to `compute an index`, also called a hash code, `into an array of buckets or slots`, from which the `desired value can be found`
