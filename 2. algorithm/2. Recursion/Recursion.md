# Recursion

Recursion is a technique used to solve computer problems by `creating a function that calls itself` until your program achieves the desired result

In theory, anything can do with a recursion, can `also be done iteratively (loop)`. Be careful with recursion because it can lead to stack overflow

```
  function inception() {
    inception();
  }
```
